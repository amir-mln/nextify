# Nextify

This is a music app that is basically a spotify clone.
The project was initially created by coding along a [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-app-next/) project-based course.

In order to not make this app just a `copy and paste` version of the course i tried to do things as differently as i could.

- I implemented the layout differently.
- I used typescript way more strictly than the instructor did.
- My state management is different.
- I even designed my own logo, and picked the name of the app on my own.

I'll add more features such as song upload, single song play, creating playlist and ... .
